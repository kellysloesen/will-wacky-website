# Will's Wacky website - static version
## Personal website for fork testing

I've forked Will's website and added some adjustments:

* Added my own (profile) picture to the forked repo
* Changed and added some text
* changed the profile picture in the HTML

I've also put it [online] (https://kellysloesen.github.io/will-wacky-website/)


This was my added picture
